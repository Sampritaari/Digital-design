# Digital Design Projects

This repository contains my personal ASIC/Digital Design projects using open-source tools like OpenLane, Yosys, and OpenROAD.

## Projects

### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- **Language**: Verilog
- **Tools**: OpenLane (RTL → GDSII)
- **Features**: Performs basic arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Results**:
  - Synthesized netlist (`synthesis/alu.synthesis.v`)
  - Layout GDS (`final/alu.gds`)
  - Timing and area reports
